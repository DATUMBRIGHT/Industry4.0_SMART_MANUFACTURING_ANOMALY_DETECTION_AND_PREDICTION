1. Trend Analysis
Linear/Non-linear trends: Is temperature gradually increasing over time?
Seasonal decomposition: Daily/weekly patterns in manufacturing
Moving averages: Smooth out noise to see underlying patterns
Detrending: Remove trends to focus on anomalies

2. Stationarity Analysis
ADF test: Is the time series stationary (mean/variance constant over time)?
Differencing: Make non-stationary series stationary
Unit root tests: Check for random walks vs mean-reverting behavior

3. Seasonality & Cyclical Patterns
Autocorrelation plots: Find repeating patterns
Periodogram analysis: Identify dominant frequencies
Seasonal decomposition: Separate trend, seasonal, and residual components
Fourier transforms: Find periodic components

4. Volatility Analysis
Rolling standard deviation: How much does variability change over time?
GARCH models: Model volatility clustering
Regime changes: Detect when system behavior fundamentally changes

5. Anomaly Detection Methods
Statistical thresholds: Z-scores, IQR-based outliers
Change point detection: When does the series behavior change?
Isolation Forest: ML-based anomaly detection
LSTM autoencoders: Deep learning for complex patterns


6. Forecasting & Prediction
ARIMA/SARIMA: Traditional time series forecasting
Prophet: Facebook's forecasting tool
Neural networks: LSTM, GRU for complex patterns
Ensemble methods: Combine multiple approaches
7. Cross-Correlation Analysis
Lead-lag relationships: Does vibration predict temperature changes?
Granger causality: Does one sensor "cause" changes in another?
Cointegration: Long-term relationships between sensors
8. Frequency Domain Analysis
Power spectral density: Energy distribution across frequencies
Wavelet analysis: Multi-scale time-frequency analysis
Hilbert-Huang transform: Adaptive time-frequency analysis
For Your Manufacturing Data Specifically:
Predictive maintenance: When will a machine fail?
Sensor drift detection: Gradual degradation over time
Fault diagnosis: What type of failure is occurring?
Performance monitoring: Is efficiency changing over time?
